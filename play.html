                    <p>Now that you have everything that you need to play, you are just missing some of the basic rules before you head out to the court!</p>

                    <p>Pickleball is similar to tennis as well as ping pong (table tennis). There are some notable differences in how the game is played compared to those sports. The tabs below will layout some basic rules, introduce you to singles play and finally introduce you to doubles play.</p>

                    <div id="tabs">
                        <ul>

                            <h2>Court Lines</h2>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="image/court.gif" />
                            </figure>
                            <p>The image above illustates the lines that you will see on a pickleball court. It is important to note that the "No Volley Zone" is also referred to as the "kitchen."  Players may not enter the "kitchen" unless the ball has landed in that area.  In that case, the player may step inside to return the ball to opposing team, but must leave the area following the return play.</p>

                            <p>Any line, other than the "Non-Volley Zone" line is considered "in."</p>

                            <h2>Scoring</h2>
                            <p>A game of pickleball is played to 11 and the winning team must win by 2. Only the serving team may score points.  Games will continue until a team has won by 2 points.</p>

                            <h2>Serving</h2>
                            <p>Unlike serving in tennis, serving in pickleball is performed in an underhand motion.  To begin a game or a turn, serves will start on the right side of the court.  Serves must land in the opposite court and not land inside the "kitchen." Any serve landing inside the "kitchen" will result in a loss of that serve.  If the serve bounces off of the top of the net and lands on the opposing teams court then that serve will be redone.</p>

                            <p>If the server is successful in scoring a point then they will serve from the other other side and will continue switching sides until they are unable to score. In doubles play, if the server is unable to score then the teammate will then serve.</p>

                            <h2>General Play</h2>
                            <p>Pickleball has a rule that is called the "double bounce rule" but it does not refer to what you may think.  The rule states that before the opposing team may return the ball that it must bounce and that the return following that must bounce as well before it is returned.  These two bounces make up the double bounce rule.  After the ball has made those two bounces then it does not have to bounce to be returned.</p>

                            <p>For more information on the rules of the game, please refer to the <a href="https://www.usapa.org/rules-summary/" target="_blank">USA Pickleball Association site</a>.</p>

                            <p>In doubles play, you will notice that the non-serving player of the serving team will play up near the line for the kitchen.  Often times, doubles play will take place near the kitchen.</p>
